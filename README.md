## by Chimamaka Chilaka


## Dataset

> The data consists of information of 114,000 loans which includes the loan amount, Term, stated monthly income of borrowers, ProsperScore(risk rating). The dataset can be found here [link] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0)

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration,  i found out that in the year 2013, there is surprisingly a large amount of loan given compared to other years and the surge months includes January, Febuary and towards the year. More loan are given for 36 or 60 months Term with 36 months having the highest loan amount.

> To have more chances of getting a higher loan amount, the Borrower should be able to have a home and Employed with their Debt-to-income ratio less than 0.50 as i noticed that most loans had the ratio of 0.36 with a threshold somewhat at 0.50.

> Having a good prosper score(risk rating) also gives an edge in borrowing higher amounts.

> There is a strong positive relationship between Monthly loan payment and Loan amount which is slightly affected by the Term.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, the focus is on the influence of Stated Monthly Income, Monthly Loan Payment, term, Debt to Income ratio on Loan Amount. The first thing is to introduce the variable of interest which is the loan amount, followed by a plot showing the distribution of other variables and then a sctter plot showing corelations.

> The following plot was plotted: Scatter plots showing the correlation between Loan Amount and  Monthly loan payment, The plot showed that borrowers with higher loan amount, the more monthly payment a borrower is likely to pay. 

> To further clarify my observation in the relationship between Loan Amount and Monthly payment, I created a multivariate scatter and point plots, to show that Loan Term plays a part in determining the amount of loan to be given out. The IsBorrowerHomeowner also influences the loan amount as people who are homeowners and have a sort of EmploymentStatus are more likely to get higher loans that people who are not.
